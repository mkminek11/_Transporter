    <p>
        This should be a game.
        I realised that unique games are the most popular.
        So I thought out new game, which was different from all other games I know.
        It's my first bigger project, so don't be disappointed.
        I would appreciate your advices.
        Thank you for visiting this project.

    <h2> About </h2>
    <p>At first, I created point of the game and rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You own a factory in a randomly generated terrain.</li>
        <li>You can buy vehicles (cars, ships and planes).</li>
        <li>The vehicles *transport* your cargo to some shops and markets.</li>
        <li>You earn money and you can buy any other vehicles.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div name="now">
    <h2> Now </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The terrain generates</li>
        <li>Your factory is placed</li>
        <li>You can see a list of three buttons:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a road - does nothing (should toggle to build-a-rouad mode where you can build roads)</li>
            <li>Quit game - quits the game</li>
            <li>Open a map - does nothing (should toggle to map mode where you can view the whole terrain)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>And a sidebar:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Base - does nothing (should move camera to your base)</li>
            <li>Plus - zooms in</li>
            <li>Minus - zooms out</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
