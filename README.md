# Transporter

### Intro
This should be a game.
I realised that unique games are the most popular.
So I thought out new game, which was different from all other games I know.
It's my first bigger project, so don't be disappointed.
I would appreciate your advices.
Thank you for visiting this project.

### About
At first, I created point of the game and rules:
- You own a factory in a randomly generated terrain.
- You can buy vehicles (cars, ships and planes).
- The vehicles *transport* your cargo to some shops and markets.
- You earn money and you can buy any other vehicles.

### Now
- The terrain generates
- Your factory is placed
- You can see a list of three buttons:
  - Build a road - does nothing (should toggle to build-a-rouad mode where you can build roads)
  - Quit game - quits the game
  - Open a map - does nothing (should toggle to map mode where you can view the whole terrain)
- And a sidebar:
  - Base - does nothing (should move camera to your base)
  - Plus - zooms in
  - Minus - zooms out
